# Advanced Robotics II
### Advanced Robotics II Final Project

**Project Overview:**

For my final project in Advanced Robotics II, I designed a treaded robot based off of EOD robotics systems. The aim was to demonstrate advanced control techniques and integrate them into a functional robot.

**Key Components:**

1. **Motors:** 
   - The robot is equipped with two DC motors that drive its movement.
   - These motors are controlled via PWM signals to regulate the robot's speed and direction.

2. **Pulse Width Modulation (PWM):**
   - PWM is used to control the amount of power supplied to the motors.
   - By adjusting the duty cycle of the PWM signal, the effective voltage and current reaching the motors can be controlled, allowing for precise speed and torque management.

3. **Control System:**
   - An embedded controller (Arduino) generated the PWM signals.
   - The controller is programmed to adjust PWM parameters based on input from a predefined control algorithm.
     
**Achievements:**

- The project successfully demonstrated effective control of motor speed and direction using PWM.
- The robot exhibited reliable and accurate movement, meeting the project's objectives.
- The project received an A+ grade, reflecting the high quality and effectiveness of the design and implementation.
